 This is my very first programming course which introduces me to the basics of object-oriented programming concepts. 
 
 I do not have a background on Computing Sciences or related fields. 
 However, with my interest and curosity in programming, I decided to take this course as the first step to explore coding.
 It has been a very helpful guide to the programming world for a beginner like me.
 
 I finished this course on October, 2019. The course worths 6 credits (~162 studying hours).
